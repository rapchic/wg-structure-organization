# DevRel Structure and Org

## Mission
The primary objective of this working group is to document best practices for structuring and organizing Developer Relations (DevRel) teams within companies, including:
- Team size
- Roles and responsibilities
- Reporting structure

Developer Relations teams vary significantly across organizations, influenced by company size, customer personas, and strategic priorities. The DevRel Foundationâ€™s Structure and Org Working Group aims to identify and categorize the different models of DevRel teams, understanding how these factors shape their function. This working group will produce resources that help organizations define, evaluate, and optimize their DevRel teams to align with business goals.

## Working Group Meetings
Most work will be done async in this repo. Co-managers will conduct ad-hoc meetings in their region to provide the opportunity for realtime discussion. Join the [mailing list](https://lists.dev-rel.org/g/wg-structure-organization) or [discord](https://discord.gg/EMTUASU6) to participate.
