# DevRel Foundation Structure and Organization Working Group Operating Charter (DRAFT)

## 1. Working Group Definition

### Tl;Dr:
The primary objective of this working group is to document analyze, and standardize best practices for structuring and organizing Developer Relations (DevRel) teams within companies, including:

- Team size
- Roles and responsibilities
- Reporting structure

Developer Relations teams vary significantly across organizations, influenced by company size, customer personas, and strategic priorities. The DevRel Foundation’s Structure and Org Working Group aims to identify and categorize the different models of DevRel teams, understanding how these factors shape their function. This working group will produce resources that help organizations define, evaluate, and optimize their DevRel teams to align with business goals.

### **1.1 Scope**

-   **Team Size**: Correlation between team size, company revenue, and developer community reach.
-   **Roles & Responsibilities**: Standardized role definitions (e.g., Developer Advocate vs. Community Manager) and competency frameworks.
-   **Reporting Structures**: Impact of reporting lines (e.g., Engineering vs. Marketing) on team autonomy, budget, and cross-functional collaboration.
-   **Maturity Models**: Evolutionary stages of DevRel teams (e.g., early-stage vs. enterprise).

### **1.2 Process for Documenting Organizational Models**

#### *1.2.1 Terminology*
-   **Org Model**: A documented structure of a DevRel team, including roles, reporting lines, and key metrics.
-   **Team Maturity**: Classification based on team lifecycle stage (e.g., **Exploratory**, **Growth**, **Scaled**).
-   **Contributor**: Any individual or organization submitting data, case studies, or frameworks.

#### *1.2.2 Research Methodology*

-   **Data Collection**:
    -   **Surveys**: Annual anonymized survey of 500+ DevRel teams across industries (B2B, B2D, OSS).
    -   **Case Studies**: Curated submissions from contributors, validated for accuracy and relevance.
    -   **Interviews**: Structured interviews with DevRel leaders (e.g., Head of DevRel, CTO).

-   **Validation Criteria**:
    -   Data must be anonymized unless explicit permission is granted.
    -   Case studies require **3+ participant reviews** for objectivity.
    -   Publicly document and tag organizational anti-patterns (e.g., “DevRel as Sales Support Only”).

#### *1.2.3 Contribution Guidelines*

-   **Submission Process**:
    -   Contributors submit via GitHub PRs using standardized templates.
    -   All submissions require a **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)** confirming rights to share data.
    -   
-   **Inclusion Criteria**:
    -   Relevance to DevRel (e.g., no pure sales/marketing teams).
    -   Demonstrated impact on developer experience or community growth.

#### *1.2.4 Review & Approval*

-   **Validation Committee**: 3 rotating participants + 1 Steering Committee liaison.
-   **Dispute Resolution**:
    -   Conflicts over model classification are resolved via **blind voting** after a 14-day discussion period.
    -   Appeals may be escalated to the Steering Committee.

#### *1.2.5 Storage & Access*

-   **Central Repository**: GitHub (`DevRel-Foundation/structure-org`) with version control.
-   **Licensing**: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC BY 4.0) for open access and derivative works.
-   
### **1.3 Persona-Driven Organizational Design**

-   **Developer Personas**: Align team structures with target developer segments (e.g., **Hobbyist**, **Enterprise Architect**).
-   **Playbooks**: Templates for structuring teams based on personas (e.g., "B2D SaaS Startup Playbook").

### **1.4 Ethical Guidelines**

-   **Anonymity**: Protect sensitive organizational data (e.g., team salaries, internal KPIs).
-   **Bias Mitigation**:
    -   Actively seek contributions from underrepresented regions (e.g., LATAM, Africa).
    -   Use inclusive language frameworks (e.g., WCAG 2.1 for documentation).

### **1.5 Maturity Framework**

A tiered system to classify DevRel teams:

| Tier | Criteria | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **T1 (Exploratory)** | <2 FTEs, ad-hoc activities | Early-stage startup |
| **T2 (Growth)** | 3-5 FTEs, defined KPIs | Series B SaaS company |
| **T3 (Scaled)** | 10+ FTEs, global programs | Enterprise (e.g., AWS, Google) |

## 2. Scope & Objectives

The working group focuses on:
- Identifying the different organizational models of DevRel teams across industries.
- Documenting best practices for structuring DevRel teams, including roles, responsibilities, and team size.
- Understanding how DevRel reporting structures impact effectiveness.
- Analyzing the impact of company size, industry, and customer persona on DevRel team design.
- Creating resources that help organizations evaluate and optimize their DevRel team structure.

### Out of Scope:
- Success metrics, or other measurement goals, as they are being worked on separately in the [Metrics and Reporting working group](https://github.com/DevRel-Foundation/wg-metrics-reporting).
- Advocacy for any specific DevRel team model as a “one-size-fits-all” solution.
- Making decisions on behalf of individual organizations.
- Prescriptive recommendations (e.g., “All T2 teams must report to Engineering”).

## 3. Working Group Composition

The Structure and Org Working Group consists of:
- **Co-Managers**: Responsible for leading discussions, facilitating collaboration, and ensuring the group meets its objectives.
- **Participants**: Any member of the DevRel Foundation who actively contributes to the working group.

This working group is open to any member who identifies as supporting developers in their role, including:
- Developer Advocates
- Community Managers
- Technical Writers
- Open Source Program Managers
- Developer Experience Engineers

To ensure broad representation, co-managers are spread across different time zones to facilitate communication and participation from a global audience.
